Tic-Tac-Toe Game in JavaScript

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It can be played by two players, one taking the role of X and the other taking the role of O.

How to Play

To play the game, open the index.html file in a web browser. You will see a 3x3 grid with empty cells. To make a move, click on an empty cell. The first player will be X, and the second player will be O.

The game will automatically detect when a player has won, and will display a message indicating which player has won. If the game ends in a tie, a message indicating a draw will be displayed.

Implementation Details
The game is implemented using object-oriented programming principles in JavaScript. The Game class represents the game, and contains methods for making moves and checking the game state.

The game state is represented as a two-dimensional array of integers, where a value of 0 represents an empty cell, a value of 1 represents an X, and a value of 2 represents an O.

The user interface is implemented using HTML and CSS, with event handlers in JavaScript to handle user input.
